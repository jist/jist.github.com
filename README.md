# jist.github.com [PENDING DEVELOPMENT]  

The lovechild of gist.github.com & jsbin.com... kinda.

For now this is just a placeholder repo.  

I hope to build a light-weight jsbin.com style editor that uses gist.github.com for it's backend. I would like the editor/previewer to be embedable so you can fork, edit & preview Gist snippets anywhere.

Gist: https://gist.github.com/  
JS Bin: http://jsbin.com/  
Gist API: http://developer.github.com/v3/gists/  
Git API: http://developer.github.com/v3/git/  
ACE editor: http://ace.ajax.org/  

I aim to use *only* clientside javascript*, so the site can be hosted on GitHub Pages under the friendly url http://jist.github.com

The urls should mimic the gist urls as close as possible e.g:

https://gist.github.com/1064750 -> http://jist.github.com/#/1064750  
https://gist.github.com/gists/1064750/edit -> http://jist.github.com/#/gists/1064750/edit  

*Ok so I may look at cheating and build a node.js server to route authenticated requests through... but I'll need to learn node first ^_^

If you think this sounds like a fun project please drop me a line to chat:
